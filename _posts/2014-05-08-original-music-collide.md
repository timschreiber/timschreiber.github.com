You know on my homepage where I mention I'm an an amateur songwriter? Well, that's not just fluff. Here's how I spend some of my time when I'm not coding. I wrote the lyrics in 2009, wrote the music between 2010 and 2013, and recorded it in my home studio in April to May 2014.

###Lyrics###

<p>I am the sun and you are the moon<br/>
I will go down and you will writhe soon<br/>
The stars in the sky watch over tonight<br/>
As bodies in motion collide</p>

<p>Collide<br/>
Collide<br/>
Collide<br/>
Collide</p>

<p>No longer bound by space and time<br/>
I'm only yours and you're only mine<br/>
There's nothing in sight but the black of night<br/>
As we descend and collide</p>

<p>Collide<br/>
Collide<br/>
Collide<br/>
Collide</p>
