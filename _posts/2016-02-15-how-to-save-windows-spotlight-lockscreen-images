One of my favorite features of Windows 10 is all the cool, new pictures that appear on my lockscreen from time to time. But I always thought it was a major oversight on the part of Microsoft that I couldn't use them as my desktop background.

I tried hitting `PrtScn` on the lockscreen, using Paint to save it as an image, and then using Google Image Search to search by image. Only once in a while could I find a matching image without all the overlays and at a high enough resolution I could use as my desktop background.
