One of my hobbies since childhood has been songwriting, and one of my earliest bucket list items is to release an album. I came close in 1999 when I recorded a couple of tracks with a Provo, UT band called Mile 5.

About a year ago, I started devoting more time to music, and about six months ago, I started writing songs and envisioning an album. Recently, I decided to get it all done by the end of the year.

Today, I reached the milestone of having half the album written and demos recorded. There's still a lot to do, but I wanted to get it out there and give the world a sneak peak.

So have a listen:
