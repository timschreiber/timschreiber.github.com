Welcome to the brand spankin' new timschreiber.com. I've been using WordPress for some side projects lately and decided it was a great time to consolidate my blog and r&eacute;sum&eacute; sites into one. Not a lot has changed in terms of content, except for my new homepage. You should go check it out if you haven't already. Other than that, there's my blog and my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and that's pretty much it.

I know I promised last year to start posting again once things calmed down, and now I intend to do just that. Nine months after I picked my family up and moved us halfway across the United States from Utah to Kentucky, we are finally settling into what I believe has become our new normal. Okay, maybe we might have been settled for a while, but... whatever.

At work, my project is suffocating under a mountain of technical debt that has accumulated over its nine year history, which led me to tweet the following question yesterday:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I know Refactor &gt; Rewrite, but is there a point at which you accrue enough technical debt that you declare bankruptcy and start over?</p>&mdash; Tim Schreiber (@tim_schreiber) <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_schreiber/status/361330768972234753">July 28, 2013</a></blockquote>

I'm still reading and considering a great many things, but that will be the topic of my next post, and apparently my job, for the foreseeable future.
