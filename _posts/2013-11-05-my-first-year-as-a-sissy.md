##or, Why Pluralsight Is Awesome##

No great big post here or anything. Just a status report that I've passed my first year as a SISsy (a.k.a. SIS employee), and as is common in the consulting world, I am coming up on the end of my first client engagement. On the horizon is a possible internal position in SharePoint development (among other opportunities). Except I don't know the first thing about SharePoint development. No worries, that's why I have my [Pluralsight][1] membership. I'll be making my way through their [SharePoint Developer Ramp-Up courses][2] over the next couple of weeks.
