After only seven short months, I am saying farewell to ZirMed and moving on to Kentucky Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of NIC. I was not actively seeking employment; it just kind of fell in my lap. But it’s one of those opportunities that I would be crazy not to pursue.

The Kentucky Interactive office is only 20 minutes from my house. Compared to my horrendous 80 to 90 minute commute each way to ZirMed, I’m getting the equivalent of more than an entire workday back each week. What to do, what to do?

The savings in time, gas, and wear and tear on my vehicle alone is well worth switching, but my new job offers me more variety and opportunities to better utilize the depth and breadth of my skills and experience and gain experience with newer technologies. I originally had high hopes for a long career with ZirMed, and it was not an easy decision to leave after such a short time. I had expected that after six months I would have seen more variety of work, used more current technologies, and integrated more successfully with my team and the company culture as a whole. But as it turned out, it just wasn’t a good fit on multiple levels.

My compensation with Kentucky Interactive is excellent, and the benefits package is well above industry norms. The local office is small, but they have the backing of a publicly-traded corporation. The people are friendly and genuine, and I’m very comfortable with them. Most importantly, it just feels “right.”

I’m looking forward to a long and prosperous career with Kentucky Interactive and NIC!
