Back in August, I wrote a post announcing my job hunt in Kentucky &mdash; I had actually been sending out r&eacute;sum&eacute;s since mid-June. Well, over the past couple of months, I've maintained a dialog with a company in Lexington which ultimately led to a trip out there this past week, and my acceptance of their job offer.

I will be working for [Software Information Systems (SIS)][1] as a Senior .NET Consultant doing pretty much the same exact same thing I do for [STG][2] now. My first gig starts October 29 with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, where I will be leading a team of programmers developing enhancements and new projects for the [Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER)][3] program. KASPER is a statewide initiative that enlists health care providers, pharmacists, law enforcement, and the inspector general's office in combatting Kentucky's prescription drug abuse problem, which is [among the worst in the nation][4] (Oxycontin is called &quot;hillbilly heroin&quot; for a reason).

SIS is very active in the Microsoft community in Lexington, Cincinnati, and Louisville. They sponsor the local .NET user group and SQL Saturday events. They seemed excited when I suggested the possibility of creating a software craftsmanship group in the area as well. SIS is also remarkably similar to STG in that it is privately owned, debt free, 140 employees, family-oriented, low-turnaround, and flush with workplace awards and other positive notoriety. Basically, they stand out in their market like STG stands out in Utah.

I wrote before that I am sad to be leaving STG, but to all things there is a time and a season. Right now, it's time to take my family to Kentucky to be closer to my wife's side of the family. Her roots are out there, and she has wanted us to go back for a long time. I'm a little scared of the change, but ready for a new adventure and excited for a challenge.

Now there's just an ass-load of work to do in the next two weeks: pack up the house, get it sold, get everyone and everything out there safely, etc. And on top of it all, I need to fit in time to study and test for an MCTS certification, which needs to be done before my start date. It's safe to say we're all more than a little overwhelmed.

I hope to resume (who am I kidding &mdash; more like start) more technical posting once things have settled down a bit.
