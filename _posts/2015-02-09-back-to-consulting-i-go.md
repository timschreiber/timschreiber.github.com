As of today, I've returned to the world of software consulting. I am now the lead developer over the eCourts applications for the [Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts][1].

This change comes as the result of cost-cutting measures my company needed to make at the end of 2014. The business began several internal development initiatives, but was evidently not prepared for the cost of custom software. To make a long story short, our Microsoft development practice was gutted, and I'm only one of two developers left on the payroll. In-house development of my previous project (CRM integration middleware) was put on indefinite hold, and a third party has been engaged to wrap up what was left hanging.

To be honest, I can't say I'm terribly sad about my situation. That CRM project kinda sucked on technological, organizational, and political levels. In my new position, though, I will be working with a good-sized team, with managers and stakeholders who are legitimately embracing Agile methodologies. They're looking to my experience to move forward and deliver high-quality software at a sustainable pace. There will be opportunities to gain experience in new technologies, and for learning and mentoring. I'm more excited and optimistic about this client engagement than pretty much anything I've worked on in a few years.

Yay me!
