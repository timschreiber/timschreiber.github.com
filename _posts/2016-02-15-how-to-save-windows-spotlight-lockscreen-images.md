It's silly and trivial, but one of my favorite features of Windows 10 is all the cool, new pictures that appear on my lockscreen from time to time. But I always thought it was an oversight on the part of Microsoft that they didn't let us use them as our desktop backgrounds.

I used to try to get the images by hitting `PrtScn` on the lockscreen, pasting it into Paint, saving it as a JPG, and then dragging it into Google Image Search to search by image. Only once in a while could I find a matching image without all the overlays and at a high enough resolution I could use as my desktop background. Each time I slogged through countless Google Images results, disappointed that I couldn't find the right pictures, I thought to myself, "there has got to be a better way."
