	<h1 class="collapse-top-margin">About Me</h1>
	<p>I love coding. Seriously, I can't believe they pay me to do it. I started programming at age eight and sold my first program when I was 13. Over the years, I've funneled that passion into a successful career, crafting beautiful web applications for enterprises, small businesses, and everything in between.</p>
	<p>Today I'm a Senior .NET Engineer for ZirMed in Louisville, KY. While I am still working to define my role, I expect to provide development, architecture, and process leadership for an Agile development team. Previously, I was a Senior .NET Consultant with Software Information Systems (SIS) in Lexington, KY; and before that, a Senior .NET Consultant for Software Technology Group in Salt Lake City, UT. Over my many years of experience, I have had the pleasure of working for &mdash; and learning from &mdash; a number of great companies in a variety of industries.</p>
	<p>I also have a few side projects I work on. I am currently building a content management system for power sports dealers (I have a family connection to the industry). Previously, I worked on an audio-based tinnitus therapy website. Earlier in my career, I created a local search and advertising website that focused on sub-metropolitan areas that other companies, like CitySearch, did not serve. My partners and I saw quite a bit of success in a number of markets before we fell victim to the .COM bubble in 2000.</p> 
	<p>I would not be where I am today were it not for some amazing teachers and mentors along the way. Today, I strive to be a teacher and mentor for the next generation of programmers. Most of my effort along those lines occurs directly within my development teams and personal network. But occasionally, I find time to write a blog article that other developers find helpful. I also enjoy presenting topics at user groups.</p>
	<p>Aside from code, I'm a husband, father, backyard barbeque pitmaster, amateur songwriter, and novice gardener. I'm kind of a Star Wars nerd (though not as much as my kids), and I really enjoy TV shows based on comic books. Oh, and I have a cat.</p>
