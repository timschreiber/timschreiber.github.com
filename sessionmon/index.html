	<h1>SessionMon</h1>
	<p>SessionMon allows website users to complete long forms without their login session expiring behind the scenes. It reduces lost time and energy, and prevents frustration due to lost work. It accomplishes this in two ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>After every one second pause in keyboard or mouse interaction, an request is made to the server to extend the sliding expiration of the auth cookie, and the session timeout counter is restarted.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Before the user's session expires, a warning modal is displayed. The modal contains a coundown to session expiration, and a button to extend the session. A couple things can happen from here:<br/>&nbsp;
			<ul>
				<li>If the countdown reaches zero, then the page is redirected to the logout page that logs the user out of their session.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
				<li>If the user clicks the button, a request is made to the server to extend the sliding expiration of the auth cookie, the session timeout counter is restarted, and the modal is hidden.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If users have multiple windows or tabs of the same website open, SessionMon synchronizes the coundown among all windows/tabs. Keyboard or mouse interaction on any of the open windows or tabs resets the counter for all of them. Dismissing the modal button dismisses the modal in all of them. To test this functionality, open this test page in multiple browser windows.</p>
	<p>For the purposes of this demonstration, session extension and logout redirect are simulated in the console.log().</p>
